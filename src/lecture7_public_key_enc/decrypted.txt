                               CHAPTER I
                            PICTURE “PUNCH”


“Sorry, son. There are no jobs open. Afraid we can’t use 
"c¼uÅ«Ã!‡J‡›fù
either.”

Tom Riley, city editor of The _Brandale Ledger_ shoved th
3+ªrÁèØh‹X
glossy black and white prints across the desk toward Jimm
/+œpÁåÀh“V�
faced him squarely, a miniature camera protruding from th
3+©iÃàÖ<ÄQ”Ék¦
shabby tweed overcoat.

“Well, thanks anyway.”

Jimmy spoke in a flat, discouraged tone as he gathered up
v±c
photographs and slid them into a cardboard folder. The ed
?¶t€üÒ<‡V—�
him with a thoughtful gaze.

“You’ve been coming around here quite often, Evans.”

“Yes, I have. I figure there’s no law against trying.”

“Sold us a few pictures, haven’t you?”

“A few,” Jimmy said with a rueful grin. “But lately I hav
3eKr€ïÜ&��†
well. There must be something radically wrong with my stu
0m÷’

Before the editor could reply, a reporter dashed up to th
3+½cÓà“<‹Ÿˆh
a report on a story assignment.

Jimmy assumed that his presence no longer was desirable. 
nùrÕùÝ-€††
leave.

“Wait a minute, Evans,” said Riley. “Sit down. I’ll be th
$d¬aÈ«Ú&Ä_
moment. I want to talk to you.”

Jimmy sat down. While the reporter talked to the editor, 
>bª&ÅòÖ;
wandered over the long news room. The clicking of a dozen
v vÅüÁ!�[€š/
the absorbed interest of the copy readers as they bent ov
3yùrÈîÚ:ÄI�›hK
even the purposeful scurrying about of the office boys, f
?gµcÄ«Û!‰…€w
a vague yearning. It would be great to belong to a place 
:b²c€ÿÛ-
_Ledger_—to have a job of his own!

Presently Riley finished with the reporter and turned to 
b´kÙ«Ò/…WœÇ

“About your pictures, son,” he said. “They’re pretty fair
vj«rŽ«ä …JÒ�k¬
lack is news punch. The woods are full of fellows who can
v¸mÅ«Ã:�J†�
pictures; but they wouldn’t recognize a good news shot if
vr¶s€çÒ*�R—�#¡
for them.”

“I’m always anxious to pick up ideas,” answered Jimmy. “A
8rùrÉûÀh�Q‡É`»
give me will be a big help—that is, if you can spare the 
"b´cŒ«þ:Ê
Riley.”

Jimmy was a tall, slender lad with a thick shock of dark,
vh¬tÌò“ …W€Éb	±
frank gray eyes set in a pleasant, firmly molded face.

The editor smiled at the young man’s persistence and swep
"+¸&Ðâß-ÄQ”
copy paper to one side.

“Well, this thing they call ‘punch’ is hard to define,” h
3+»cÇêÝf
“Sometimes it’s a picture which ties up with a big front 
&j¾c€øÇ'–GÜÉE§
instance, a bank robbery, an explosion, or maybe a shipwr
3h²(

“Then again, it may be human interest stuff. A policeman

see, a free lance photographer must have ideas, and be on

important news is breaking.”

“Isn’t there a lot of luck to that—being on hand when it 
>j©vÅåÀwp

“Yes, but not always,” admitted the editor. “Learn to use
vr¶sÒ«Û-…ZÒˆp
well as your feet. Be ready when an opportunity comes alo

“The one I’m looking for is a steady job on a newspaper.”


“We’re not likely to have an opening on the _Ledger_ for 
;d·rÈø“<‹‘†nû
If a job does turn up, it probably will go to an experien
5n½&ÎîÄ;”_‚Œq
photographer.”

“But how can a fellow get experience when no one will giv
3+¸&ÂîÔ!ŠP—›
any chance?”

With a trace of impatience, the editor replied gruffly:

“You’ll have to create your own job. No one will hand it 
"dùÏþ“'Š“
silver platter. Study news photographs and try to discove
$+®nÁÿ“%…U—š
them click. Learn how to take good pictures under every p
9xªoÂçÖ
lighting condition. Then maybe someday you’ll stumble int
9+¶hÅ«À'Ä\›Ž#°
couldn’t afford to turn it down.”

Riley reached for a sheet of copy paper, a signal that th
3+°hÔîÁ>�[…Ék±
ended. But as the young man started away, a tired droop t
9+±oÓ
shoulders, he added:

“I didn’t intend to discourage you, Evans. You’re young, 
!b­n€ûß-ŠJ‹Él
time ahead. Not over eighteen, are you?”

“Sixteen.”

“You look older. Well, keep at it, and one of these days 
/d¬&ÍêÊh‰_™Œ
the grade.”

Only slightly encouraged by the words, Jimmy pocketed his
vx¸kÐçÖ;Ä_œ�
left the office. Rather than face the knowing glance of t
>nùcÌîÅ)�Q€
man, he walked down three flights of steps to the street.


For months now, since graduating from Brandale High Schoo

scarcely a newspaper or syndicate in town where he had no

Jimmy shifted his camera to a more comfortable position,

aimlessly down a street leading toward the waterfront. Wh

“Hi, Jimmy!” called a familiar voice. “What are you doing

“Well, I don’t know,” Jimmy returned. “I’ve spent a lot o

“Maybe I will. Thanks for the tip.”

They had reached the next corner where the Green Hut Hamb
#y¾cÒ«÷!Š[€
stood. Jerry paused.

“Let’s have one, Jimmy,” he proposed. “I’ll treat.”

Jimmy hesitated, then shook his head. Lately he had accep

too many favors from his friend.

“Oh, come along,” Jerry urged, pulling him through the do

Jimmy was hungry, for he had not eaten since breakfast an

late afternoon. Perched high on a stool at the counter, h

the cook, pound sandwich meat into two flat cakes which h

Jimmy nodded mechanically. “Wish I had been here,” he sai

As he ate his sandwich, Jimmy stared out the window. He d

A loud screeching of brakes on the pavement, caused Jimmy
v¶&×ãÚ:ˆ
around. A black sedan, ignoring a traffic light which had
vmµgÓãÖ,ÄX€†n
green to red, plunged across the intersection at high spe
3oõ&Ôä“+–_��
into the side of a blue automobile driven by a woman.

Both boys leaped down from their stools. Jimmy pulled his

camera from his pocket, adjusting it as he ran out into t

taking mental note of the fact, Jimmy saw that the man wa

with dark hair and bushy brows. His companion who did not

The woman driver also left her car. One glance at the dam

and she began to berate the two men in an angry voice.

“Just see what you have done! You’ll have to pay for this
w+�r€üÒ;
entirely your fault because you went against the light!”

A crowd had gathered. Opinion was divided as to who had c

man offered to telephone for the police.

At mention of the word “police,” the slim fellow spoke in

his companion, who promptly leaped into the sedan. They d

away, the car turning at the first corner.

“Someone stop them!” cried the woman helplessly. “I haven

No other automobile had taken up the pursuit, and indeed,

“Excuse me,” he said to the woman. “I just took two pictu

“Then I could trace the men and have them arrested!”

“That was a nice break for me,” he declared. “I should pi

“How about selling your pictures to the _Ledger_?” asked

“Oh, go on!” said Joan, tossing her head. “Who wants to s

Jimmy had taken over a large closet adjoining the bathroo

and hypo trays, he had equipped it with a film drying mac

“Yes, sir.”

“We want to talk to you about the auto accident at the co

“That’s right. I just finished developing them.”

“Let’s have a look at those films.”

As Jimmy worked in the darkroom with the second policeman

The car left the neighborhood street and toured down Jack

A thrill of excitement ran down Jimmy’s spine. He leaned

Minutes later they swerved to a stop before a dilapidated

As Jimmy crouched low, the policemen both leaped from the

Jimmy stared. Then, realizing that he was losing a grand

sprang from the cruiser and focused his camera. His hand

opened the shutter. He had ruined the exposure.

Steadying his nerves, he quickly took a second and third

Yet as Jimmy entered the newspaper office at a quarter to

forgotten. As he passed through the news room, only a few

In the photographic department adjoining the wire-photo r

“Are you Mr. Orris?”

“Nuts! Riley always bellows, but he never holds it agains

The photographer arose and stretched himself. “Your name

“Jimmy is all right, but you need a niftier moniker than

He went ahead, snapping on the electric lights, Jimmy’s e

“Orris, this is Flash Evans.”

The older man smiled briefly upon hearing the nickname an

“Good morning, Evans,” he said coldly. “You did a fine jo

On his first assignment, a convention at the Hotel Branda

“Get down to the Y.W.C.A.,” the editor ordered. “They’re

Flash caught a street car farther downtown. He was nervou

building everything was made easy for him. He merely said

A dozen swimmers were waiting in the tank room. Flash had

Hurrying back to the newspaper office, he ran the films t

“Names?”

By fight time the armory was packed. The buzzing rumble o

With tolerant good humour the crowd sat through the first

preliminary bouts, but when the third dragged itself out 
?e­i€ê
clinching match, the customers began to call impatiently:


“Give us Gezzy! We want Brady!”

At last the main bout was brought on and Flash watched th

“Riley can’t do any kicking this time,” he thought. “I ou

“I’m Flash Evans, the new photographer. I have some work

The old man gazed sharply at the boy.

“You don’t look like a photographer to me. No, sir!”

“Of course.”

Rather puzzled, the young photographer followed him to th

Dreading to go home, Flash wandered into Joe’s hamburger

The paper carried three excellent photographs of the fire

Also on the front page appeared Flash’s own name, togethe

Flash stuffed the paper into his pocket and walked home.

“I’m proud of you, Jimmy,” his mother said tremulously af

“Then I would consider myself still on the staff until Mr

Flash leaped from bed. Pulling on his robe, he took the s

“Hello, Evans?” barked Riley’s voice. “What in blazes is

“Want me to help you develop those?” Fred Orris inquired,

With the photographer standing at his elbow, Flash follow

pictures came up quickly with good contrast.

“They’re all right,” said Wells with emphasis. “Orris can

“My fire pictures were good, too. Something happened to t

Then, too, in some manner word circled the office by mean

Flash could not really blame them.

He did his work efficiently, giving Orris and Riley no ch

One morning he was waiting for the elevator when two repo

Flash digested this bit of information as he rode up to t

“Is this the _Ledger_ plane?” questioned Flash tersely.

“That’s right,” the pilot responded.

“May I have the pictures?”

“Pictures? I just gave them to a fellow named Evans from

The pilot stared. “Then someone has pulled a fast one! Fe

“Luke Frowein, a _Globe_ man!” Flash explained grimly. “A

enough to fall for the trick!”

Whirling, he ran down the cement, through the station, to
v±c€æÒ!Š•ˆwû
There was no sign of Luke Frowein.

A taxi cruised slowly past. Flash quickly hailed it.

“To the _Globe_ building!” he ordered tersely. “I’ll give

buck if you step on it!”

The cab roared along the highway at fifty miles an hour,

Flash ran around to the rear entrance of the building. As

“Your pictures?” repeated Frowein mockingly. “Don’t know

Flash could see a flat, bulky package protruding from the

“Keep your hands out of my pockets!” he ordered unpleasan

The cage of the freight elevator had started to descend s

His right arm coiled back, then lashed out in a swift, su

Before he could get up, Flash leaped on him and jerked th

The package plainly was marked for the _Ledger_.

“Hey, get off, will you!” Frowein growled. “Can’t you tak

Flash coolly pocketed the package before removing himself

“Your brand of humor doesn’t appeal to me,” he retorted.

“See here,” Frowein protested in quick alarm, “you’re not

“A joke which would have cost me my job!”

                            _A CRY FOR HELP_


Flash delivered the airplane crash pictures into the hand
%+¶`€ÈÚ<�
Editor Riley, whose only comment was that it had taken hi
;+µiÎì“-ŠQ‡Žk
to make the trip. In fifteen minutes the prints were on t
>nùqÉùÖ8ŒQ††
cylinders, by means of which the photos were transmitted 
"dùiÔãÖ:
sections of the country. A short time later the _Ledger_ 
;j½c€ÿÛ-ÄM†›f¡
with a back page devoted to the exclusive shots.

Not even Joe Wells heard the story of how close the _Ledg

being scooped by the _Globe_. Flash kept the affair stric
"g &Ôä“ �S�Œoù
but he had learned a bitter lesson. While he knew there w
3y¼&ÆîÄh”[€šl	¦
who would stoop to Luke Frowein’s low trickery, he never

entirely trust a rival photographer.

In the days which followed, Flash performed his duties wi
"cùwÕâÖ<
efficiency. He photographed fashion shows, golf tournamen

meets, and no matter how routine the assignment, accepted
vb­&ÃãÖ-–X‡…oû
His unassuming ways gradually won him friends, both in an

office. However, Fred Orris remained cold and aloof.

Now and then, if Flash worked late at night, Herm would d

out about himself. One day he questioned Joe Wells regard
?e¾&ÔãÖ
watchman’s past life.

“Oh, he’s just a queer duck,” the photographer replied ca

“Married?”

“They say his wife died about fifteen years ago. He had a

promising young fellow, they tell me. Old Herm saved and

him through college.”

“Then I suppose the boy repaid him by going his own way?”


“No, the boy was grateful enough, but he up and died. Old

“I’ve noticed the habit.”

To Flash, Old Herm never mentioned his son or his trouble

showed a deep interest in the young photographer’s aspira

progress on the paper.

“It does my old bones good to see a cub like you get on,”

heartily. “So many boys these days want the path smoothed

It was rather difficult for Flash to imagine that Old Her

“I’m beginning to get on top of my work at last,” he conf

“At first it seemed as if everything was against me, but

coming my way again.”

The two friends spent an hour in the pool, swimming and d

topped it off by taking part in a rough, exhausting game 
9mùqÁÿÖ:ÄN�…lI
After their showers, they dropped into Gus’s place for ha

huge slices of apple pie.

“My treat, this time,” grinned Flash, slapping a dollar o

“Can’t you manage to save another John Gelette or marry t

daughter?” joked Jerry.

“Never will live that rescue down. I want to earn my next

While they ate, Flash showed Jerry copies of some of his 
4n­rÅù
pictures, many of which had been printed in the _Ledger_.


“You sure like your work, don’t you?” Jerry asked.

“I’d rather be a newspaper photographer than anything els

assignment, the better you like it.”

Jerry shrugged as he climbed down from the stool.

“Every man to his taste,” he said. “I think I’ll stick to

or maybe a dentist.”

The big clock on the Fisher building chimed eleven as the

Flash said:

“Guess I ought to hit the hay. The old alarm goes off reg

“It is getting late,” Jerry agreed.

They cut through an alley to a deserted street on the bus

“What was that?” Flash demanded, whirling around. “Sounde

The street was empty of pedestrians. For a moment they we

beneath their feet.

“Must have been in one of the buildings!” exclaimed Jerry

He and Flash stood directly in front of the Sam Davis Hom

“So do I!”

With one accord they rushed down a flight of wooden steps

Jerry ran out to the street, while Flash and the building

“Never heard of it,” commented Flash.

“You’ll have to hurry,” added Jerry as he heard the wail

from far down the street. “We’re going to have visitors.”


Flash seldom went anywhere without his miniature camera a

Flash and Jerry waited while the firemen inspected the ba

“You go on home without me,” urged Flash. “I want to run

“Does the paper print tonight?” Jerry asked in surprise.

“The last edition is out. But the Sunday editor will want

“No evidence to support that theory, is there?”

“None yet. But it’s been rumored that the Elston Apartmen

“Haven’t seen anything about it in the newspapers.”

“It’s a ticklish story to print. The fire chief won’t giv

Flash walked swiftly to the _Ledger_ building. Lights wer

twenty minutes of midnight before the men who worked the

would come on duty.

In the hallway Flash met Old Herm, who seemed surprised t

“Want I should let you into the office?” he asked.

Flash shook his head. “No, thanks, Herm. I have a key now

The photography department was deserted. Closing himself

the films had been put through the tanks. He washed them

When the prints were finished, he slipped them into an en

note of explanation to accompany them, and dropped the pa

city editor’s vacant desk.

As Flash went out the front door, he met Fred Orris and a

“Oh, well, he’ll find out tomorrow!”

A bus, the last one until two o’clock rumbled down the st

At six-thirty he was sleeping soundly when the alarm buzz

Flash started up, and then as the realization came to him

But he had been thoroughly aroused and could not sleep ag

a time staring at the ceiling. From the street he heard t

whistle of a boy on a bicycle. The Sunday paper thudded a

front porch.

Jumping out of bed, Flash put on his robe and stole quiet

stairway. He shot up the blinds and unlocked the door.

Eagerly he stripped off the brown wrapper and glanced at 
"c¼&ÆùÜ&�‚ˆd
of the _Ledger_. His fire pictures were not there.

Flash thumbed rapidly through the paper. There were pictu

Finally, on the back page of Section C he found a brief f

All day Sunday Flash remained deeply depressed. He had be

“I can’t understand it,” Flash confessed. “The _Ledger_ h

for being a fighting paper. And there was nothing libelou

“Maybe the editor was afraid to make a direct accusation

“That’s possible,” admitted Flash, “but it still doesn’t

“Never did.”

“Probably it’s a fake company, just as Sam Davis believes

_Ledger_ is missing a chance for a big story.”

“And some good pictures,” added Jerry, grinning. “Well, c

they’ll be printed in tomorrow’s paper.”

Upon his way to work Monday morning, Flash bought an earl

Riley was occupied making out an assignment sheet when Fl

7e½&ÓûÜ#�

“I see you didn’t use my fire pictures, Mr. Riley.”

“What’s that?” the editor barked.

Flash repeated his words.

“Fire pictures?” Riley demanded. “Didn’t find anything of

“I left an envelope with a note of explanation. That was

“Better ask Clingston about it,” said Riley carelessly. “

Flash nodded and entered the photography department. The

number and placed a call.

A sleepy voice answered: “Yeah? Clingston speaking.”

Flash nearly lost his courage as he realized he had arous

“This is Evans. I’m checking up on some pictures of the S

“Didn’t find them,” the editor answered.

“That’s funny. They were in an envelope.” Flash described

repeating what Sam Davis had told him.

“We could have used those shots,” Clingston said regretfu

“I don’t see how it could have happened.”

“The janitor may have brushed the envelope into the waste

“Shall I print them up again?”

“No use now,” Clingston returned. “The story is two days

Flash hung up the receiver just as Fred Orris entered the

thoughtfully watched the head photographer as he hung his

“Orris,” he began abruptly.

“Well?”

“When you came into the building Saturday night did you n

“No, I didn’t,” Orris answered shortly. “What of it?”

“I left some there—fire pictures. They disappeared before

Orris shot Flash a sharp, questioning glance.

“Say, just what are you trying to suggest?”

“Nothing.”

“Well, I trust not,” the head photographer muttered griml

An angry flush stained Flash’s face. With an effort, he k

a sharp retort. Orris would like nothing better than to d

Getting up abruptly from the telephone table, he went int

and closed the door. He distrusted the head photographer

Thinking there was a possibility that the janitor knew so

Later that morning, Flash was testing his camera, when Ri

into the office, a batch of prints in his hand.

“Anything wrong?” Fred Orris asked in alarm.

“Nothing in particular,” Riley replied. “I was wondering 
!c &×î“+…P`�
have these pictures printed with a duller finish. Give ’e

“But Mr. Riley, all the other editors want glossy prints.

“Is there any reason why I can’t have a duller finish?”

“Well, yes, there is,” Orris responded in a conciliatory

“Oh, you do?” interposed Orris, an edge to his voice. “Su

“I was trying it out the other day,” explained Flash. “Al

“And what finish will it make?” Riley inquired with inter

“I’ll show you,” Flash offered. “I think I have a few sam

He brought the prints. Riley glanced at them and beamed.

“As you wish,” the head photographer returned surlily, “b

After Riley had gone, Orris offered no comment. He experi

pest.

However, the new prints made an attractive change in the

Riley was pleased.

Three days later, after an uneventful afternoon, Flash an

Flash took his friend seriously. “I’ll be the first one t

“But nothing spectacular.”

“Spectacular pictures don’t drop into a fellow’s lap ever

The door opening into the news room stood ajar. From wher

they could hear the teletype machines pounding out their

parts of the country. Suddenly everyone in the office was

/™ª&ÅóÐ!�[–
shout:

“The _Alexander_ has gone down!”

Flash and the other photographers ran into the adjoining

about the teletype machine. The first bulletin was brief,

Elated at the assignment, Flash rushed after Joe Wells to

camera equipment.

“Glad Riley is sending you instead of Orris,” his friend

briefly.

On their way to the street, the two photographers stopped

cashier’s office, and were given an envelope containing n

Hailing a taxi, they rode directly to the harbor where Da

Flash and Joe climbed into the cockpit. Before the plane

“Hold it!” he shouted.

Dave French throttled down and waited.

“Now what?” muttered Joe Wells.

“Riley of the _Ledger_ just telephoned,” the man informed

“Then the trip is off!” Wells exclaimed in disgust. “I wa

“Did Riley say we were to come back to the office?” Flash

“He didn’t say anything about that. His message was that

Wells had started to climb from the cockpit, but Flash pu

“A man can drown in thirty seconds,” murmured Wells gloom

The plane flew steadily eastward, sighting small sailing

larger vessels. Presently, Dave French throttled down, an

large steamship which could be seen some distance away.

“The _Belmonia_!” he shouted.

Flash’s pulse quickened and a queer feeling came into the
v{°r€äÕhŒW�
stomach. His plan had seemed simple back on land. But now

“We’ll wait to see that you’re picked up,” Wells shouted.


“No!” Flash hurled back.

He was convinced that as long as the seaplane remained in

Captain Sorenson never would rescue him.

The plane dropped lower and lower until it flew level not

Then the water loomed up and he bent slightly to take it

The force of the fall plunged Flash to a tremendous depth

The sailors fell to rowing steadily, and in a short while

Stepping on deck, Flash found himself confronted by Capta

Flash took out the waterproof container, and to his relie

Circulating among the passengers, Flash found them more t

Flash worked swiftly and was ready to leave the ship by t

sighted Dave French’s seaplane. Already long shadows had

Approaching the mate who had seemed more friendly than th

contact with the seaplane.

“Not a chance of it,” the mate told him regretfully. “You

waste your breath to ask Captain Sorenson. I’m afraid you

stay aboard until we dock.”

Flash had no intention of losing the advantage he had gai

that if he could get back to Brandale ahead of the _Belmo

_Ledger_ would scoop every paper in the country with its 
&bºrÕùÖ;Ä_œ�

His decision made, Flash sauntered toward the stern of th

The drone of the seaplane grew louder, drawing many passe

They waved and he returned the signal although he was far

Scrambling to the rail, he poised an instant. Then he lea

Rolling over on his back, he saw that the seaplane had tu

“Did you get the pictures?” Joe Wells demanded eagerly.

Flash nodded and offered the container. There was an anxi

The roar of the wind as the seaplane once more took to th

Flash borrowed a dry outfit, and the two photographers ca

Flash and Joe were the target of envious glances, from th
3+¶rÈîÁ
photographers, as they entered the department. Shutting t

the darkroom, they decided to develop the rolls of film o

avoid any risk of scratching the negatives.

The rolls were of all sizes and length. Anxiously, Flash

“Better luck on the others—maybe,” said Joe gloomily.

Another roll turned out to be over-exposed. Not until the

Without much hope, they developed the last roll. Almost a

neither of the photographers spoke. Then Wells laughed al

“Beauties!” he exclaimed. “Six of them!”

While his friend finished the pictures, Flash hurried to

report the good fortune to Riley. The editor bade him tel

“Thank you,” said Flash, flushing with pleasure.

On his way home from work the following afternoon, Flash

“I’m glad you dropped around,” he declared heartily. “You

The furniture store owner crumpled an advertising circula

“I suppose it’s not easy for the police to get evidence,”
vy¼kÁùØ-€
Flash. “Most store owners who are approached probably pay

“Sure,” agreed Sam Davis. “They reason that the police ca

“And the store owners are afraid to testify against them

“That’s it,” Davis nodded grimly. “Why, I know a half doz

“Can you give me a list of the persons?”

“I could,” the store man said reluctantly, “but I don’t s

would do. It might only cause trouble.”

“I’ll not publish the list,” Flash promised. “You see, I 
"c¶sÇãÇh­Ÿ€d¡
try to do a little investigation work on my own.”

“I don’t think you’ll get to first base, young man,” Sam 
j¯oÓ«À)�Z
discouragingly. “But I’ll give you the names. Only don’t 
3}¼t€çÖ<ÄQœ

“I won’t,” Flash promised.

The store owner wrote several names and addresses on a sh

“By the way,” he said, “what happened to those pictures y

Flash had anticipated the question.

“Oh, the paper decided not to use them,” he replied carel

“In the _Ledger’s_ case it was a matter of news value rat

“Oh, I see. Well, I’m just as glad the pictures didn’t ap

Flash took the list of names. When he was outside the bui

studied the addresses. Many of the places were close at h
7e½(€ÃÖh€[‘€g±
to make a few calls during the hour which remained before
vf¶uÔ«Ñ=—WœŒp
houses would lock their doors.

His first stop was at the Globe Chain Store, but the mana

speaking man, flatly denied he ever had heard or had deal

representative of the North Brandale Insurance Company. T

calls were equally unsuccessful. Although the store owner
%+½oÓèß'—[–Éa
their manner that the company was unpleasantly familiar t
9+­nÅæŸh�V—�
had nothing to say.

With time remaining for only one more visit, Flash droppe

offices of the Fenmore Warehouse. A stenographer was in t

“Am I too late to see Mr. Fenmore for a moment?” Flash in

“Mr. Fenmore is still in his office,” the girl replied. “

At that moment, a stout bald-headed man came out of the i

“You wished to see me?”

“Yes, I did. I’m Jimmy Evans from the _Ledger_.”

“I’m afraid I can’t see you tonight. I was just starting

“What’s it about?” Mr. Fenmore asked curiously.

“The North Brandale Insurance Company,” Flash answered. “

Mr. Fenmore’s manner instantly changed.

“Come into the office,” he invited abruptly.

The door closed behind Flash. He dropped into a leather c

of Mr. Fenmore’s desk.

“Now what do you wish to know?” the man asked him. “You s

“A photographer,” Flash corrected. “And this is strictly

He then went on to explain his interest in the recent fir

“Can you describe the agent?”

Flash realized that the description was worthless for it

Flash made no progress with the investigation during the

Two small downtown fires occurred, admittedly of question

but there was no evidence to attribute them to the work o

Many times Flash had photographed the edifice for his own

struck with the thought that he might be able to get a re

“I’ll come back here tonight and try it!” he decided. “Ev

Walking to the park, he studied the lighted tower from ev

Finally he decided he could get the best picture from the

Suddenly the basement room was flooded with light.

“Reach!” commanded a gruff voice from the door.

Flash saw the revolver lying almost at his finger tips. H

From across the room another gun belched flame, and there

The faces of the three men all had been turned squarely t

“He hasn’t yet.”

“There was a building watchman who saw one of the men—”

Flash silently followed the officer down the hallway to t

Now that he reflected, he realized that the watchman had

that when they had been together, he usually was the one

“But it couldn’t have been Herm,” he repeated to himself.

They presently located the watchman on the fifth floor. A

“Lookin’ for me?” he inquired uneasily.

“You are the night watchman here?” asked the policeman, g

“That’s right. Anything the matter?”

“Nothing to be skittish about,” the officer said. “All we

“Answerin’ questions!” the old fellow echoed timidly. “I

“You were in the building at eleven-thirty tonight?”

“Oh, yes, sir,” Old Herm replied. “I’m always here then.

“On the sixth floor, sir. I punch a clock there every nig

“And you punched it tonight?”

“Oh, yes, sir. I’ve never missed in five years.”

“Any one see you do it?”

“Maybe so and maybe not so,” Old Herm answered vaguely. “

While the old fellow’s voice and face was innocence itsel

The officer studied the watchman for a moment. Then he to

“Ever see that before?”

“Why, ah, yes, I have,” the watchman stammered.

“Yours isn’t it?”

“Yes,” Old Herm admitted readily, “it’s the key to the ja

“We didn’t find it in the basement. We picked it up in th

“Yes, sir, I was. I drop in there on my rounds when the d

“At what hour were you there tonight?”

“Just a bit after 10:30. That’s when I ring the time cloc

So far, Old Herm’s account of his whereabouts left no gro

“You’ve been around here quite awhile, haven’t you?” the

“Suppose we check on that time register,” he said.

He led Flash and the policeman to the sixth floor. The re

“It probably was an inside job,” the officer commented, d

lost key into the watchman’s hand.

“Was something stole?” Old Herm asked anxiously.

“A film from the photography department,” responded the p

“An important one,” added Flash. “I had just finished dev

“Shoo, you don’t say!” Old Herm muttered. “That’s bad. Na

“It won’t do me any good,” Flash returned.

Turning, he followed the police officer down the hall, le

When they were beyond earshot, Flash said: “You were sati

“For that matter, what reason would anyone in the buildin

“Might have been. I’m satisfied it was an inside job and

After the officer had gone, Flash returned to the darkroo

As he passed through the news room a moment later, the ed

him at the desk.

“Here’s something that may interest you,” he said, thrust

copy paper into Flash’s hand. “One of our reporters just

About ten minutes ago an old man named Andy Simpson was r

“Andy Simpson!” Flash exclaimed. “Not the watchman at the

“Same fellow.”

“Run over deliberately?”

“No. It appears he was dazed or had been drinking too muc
>%ùGÎòÄ)�
according to the story of the motorist, he ignored the tr

and walked straight into the path of the car.”

“Andy Simpson was the one person who could have thrown ne

arson case,” Flash muttered. “He met ‘H. J.,’ the man who
vbª&ÓþÃ8‹M—�#º
be the brains of the arson gang. Now the police never wil

get a description.”

He read the brief item through and handed it back to the

had he felt more discouraged. With Andy Simpson dead, his
vf°uÓâÝ/
picture was of greater importance than ever. But it was d
3m°hÉÿÖ$�•†mû
He never would see it again.

While no word of blame was spoken, Flash saw several repo

would have heard the story.

“I’m getting a record for failures,” he thought as he mad

attack, things may keep on happening.”

The previous mishaps, while personally humiliating, had n

serious. But now, with Andy Simpson dead, the loss of the

brought to trial.

As the bus rolled along the deserted neighborhood street,
vMµgÓã“<‘LœŒg
over in his mind every possible person who might have bee

and Old Herm seemed the most likely suspects. The watchma

“There’s Luke Frowein of the _Globe_,” Flash mused. “He w

A light was burning in the Evans cottage as the bus drew

                           _OUT OF THE PAST_


Flash awoke the next morning to find himself clawing the 
4n½&ÃçÜ<ŒWœŽ

“Wow! What a nightmare!” he gasped. “Worse than the real

He became aware that someone was rapping on the bedroom d

“Wake up, Jimmy!” his mother called. “It’s almost seven!”


His feet struck the floor. “Be right up,” he answered. “I

Dressing hurriedly, he snatched a cup of coffee, and race

door just as his bus came into view. He barely reached it

aboard a moment before the door slammed shut. Flash dropp

the coin box and sagged into an empty seat beside an elde

white-haired gentleman with a cane.

Startled, Flash glanced quickly at the elderly man. He wa

“You knew my father?” he inquired in astonishment.

“Jimmy Evans, aren’t you?”

“Yes, I am.”

“That’s the spirit,” the old man approved. “I remember on

“Tell me about it, sir,” urged Flash.

“It’s not much of a story. I worked in the cashier’s offi

“But your father didn’t agree with the other higher-ups t

“With the result that you were cleared?” Flash questioned

“Did you say Ronne?” Flash asked in a startled voice.

“Yes, his name was Dick Ronne. He would be a middle-aged

The old man pressed a signal bell, and Flash arose to let

“Well, glad to have met you,” Mr. Brown murmured. “Don’t

licked it!”

“Thank you, sir,” smiled Flash. “You’ve given me somethin
1+­i€ÿÛ!ŠU
about.”

And it was true, although not exactly in the way that Mr.
vI«i×å
understood. The conversation had suggested to the young p
>d­iÇùÒ8Œ[€Éb
most startling possibility.

Old Herm’s last name was Ronne, and Ronne by no means was
vjùeÏæÞ'Šœˆnû
Flash recalled that Joe Wells had mentioned something abo

having had a son who was no longer living. Could it be th

the person his father had caused to be discharged years b
3m¶tÅ§“?…MÒ¦o
Herm’s son?

“First chance I get I’m going to ask Joe more about it,”

himself.

So deeply was Flash absorbed in his thoughts that the bus

9y·cÒ«Û-ÄI“…h±
hurriedly back to the _Ledger_ building. He was five minu

Fred Orris, hat pushed back on his head, was repairing th

camera as Flash entered the photography department. He ma

comment upon the arson story or what had occurred in the 
2j«mÒäÜ%ÄJšŒ
previous night. Instead he said sharply:

“You’re fifteen minutes late, Evans.”

“Five,” corrected Flash. “This clock is fast.”

“Get over to the courthouse and shoot some pictures of th
3+ŸsÌÿÜ&ÄS‡›g§
trial. And bring them back, too. Remember, we want pictur
3xõ&ÎäÇ
adventure stories!”

A glint of anger flamed in Flash’s eyes. He went over to 
"c¼&ÌäÐ#�ZÒŠb°
for his camera and equipment, deliberately taking his tim

“Orris,” he said coolly, “the elevator man tells me you w

“So what?”

“Maybe you didn’t hear what happened to me in the darkroo

“Listen,” Orris flared, “are you trying to intimate that

“I’m just checking up. Thought you might have noticed som

“Well, I didn’t,” the photographer answered shortly. “Wha

Flash made no answer. He slipped the camera strap over hi

went out the door. All morning he was kept busy at the co

shooting pictures of witnesses, prosecutor, judge, jury a

Some of his pictures Flash had sent back to the _Ledger_ 
4rùkÅøÀ-ŠY—›-
He carried the remaining holders with him, and upon devel

took the precaution of locking himself into the darkroom.


His work completed without mishap, he dropped across the

belated lunch. On the stool next to him sat a _Ledger_ re

covered the police and fire departments.

“Anything new on the arson case?” Flash inquired.

The reporter shook his head.

“That fellow Slater refuses to talk. And if the police ha

Flash nodded gloomily.

“It was a dandy picture. And one of the men was supposed

“Police haven’t any idea who broke into the darkroom and

Flash had not forgotten his talk with old Mr. Brown. At t
>nù`ÉùÀ<
opportunity upon his return to the office he sought Joe W
3gµu€êÝ,
quietly questioned him about Old Herm.

“I’ve told you all I know,” the photographer insisted. “W

“I haven’t any definite theory,” Flash replied evasively.


“Well, don’t get ideas about Old Herm. He’s simple minded

criminal. Why, the fellow has a crippled leg—”

“Just the same, he could have done it. He’s strong as an

“You’re almost as goofy as Old Herm,” Wells scoffed. “Fir

Orris did it, and next you blame the watchman. Maybe it w

“I’m not accusing anyone,” Flash defended himself. “All I

trying to check every angle and keep an open mind.”

“Doesn’t sound very open to me. I’ll grant you some might

close myself into the darkroom.”

“The next time our mysterious visitor pays a call he may

“Why not make Colt 45’s standard equipment for all _Ledge

“You wouldn’t be laughing so hard if you had been the one

Herm’s son?”

“Never heard it. Why don’t you ask him?”

“That’s an idea,” said Flash. “Maybe I will.”

Since the watchman did not come on duty until after the d
7rùqÏùØ-–MÒ�b
left the building, it meant that to talk with the old fel

make a special trip back to the _Ledger_. Flash decided i

worth his trouble.

Accordingly, he remained downtown that evening. After att

he returned to the nearly deserted building. Locating Old

“Workin’ late again?” the watchman inquired, pausing in s

“No, just dropped in for a minute. I see they keep you bu

“I’m at it without a let-up,” the old man sighed. “Since

Herm rambled on for several minutes, but presently Flash

“Whom do you mean?” Flash questioned in a puzzled voice.

But old Herm did not answer. Tears rolled down his wither

Turning his back upon Flash, he hobbled painfully away.




                              CHAPTER XXI

With mingled feelings of sympathy and misgiving, Flash wa

over the death of his son.

From the conversation he had gleaned one fact of importan

something to think about.

Returning home, Flash found his mother locking up the hou

night.

“Sorry to be so late,” he apologized. “I waited at the of

“You seem to have taken a deep liking to that old watchma

“Not exactly a liking,” Flash corrected. “Herm is an inte

“Ronne?” she repeated thoughtfully. “The name sounds fami

young man employed at the _Post_, who was discharged for

funds.”

“Not Richard or Dick Ronne?”

“I’m not certain, but I believe that was his first name.”


“Was it Father’s fault he was discharged?”

“He was the one who discovered the theft, I believe. Anot

“Thomas Brown.”

“Why, yes,” Mrs. Evans acknowledged in surprise. “But how

“Did you ever hear what became of Dick Ronne after he was

“No, your father persuaded the owner of the paper to take

“What caused the boy’s death, Mother?”

“I can’t tell you that because I never was particularly i

“You never saw the man yourself, I suppose?”

“Dick Ronne’s father? No, nor the boy either. But why are
vr¶s€øÜ
interested, Jimmy?”

“Well, I thought Old Herm Ronne might have been the boy’s

a son by that name who died, and he knew Dad.”

“Dear me,” murmured Mrs. Evans, frowning. “And the old fe

“Don’t worry about it,” Flash said quickly. “He’s always 
4n¼h€ýÖ:�
friendly. I rarely ever see him.”

Dismissing the subject, he locked the remaining doors for

and followed her up the stairway.

“I want to get up early in the morning,” he said careless

“Five!” his mother gasped. “My, but you are ambitious!”

Flash did not tell her what he had in mind. He had decide

came to nothing, no one need ever know that he had regard

with suspicion.

Even before the alarm went off at five o’clock, Flash was

dressed quietly, and brewing himself a strong cup of coff
3nõ&ÃêÆ/ŒJÒˆ
bus going downtown.

Timing himself, he drew near the rear entrance of the _Le

at exactly six o’clock, the hour Old Herm went off duty. 
nùuÔîÃ8�ZÒ€mº
the loading dock where Jeff, a colored boy, was polishing

“Lookin’ for someone, suh?” the lad asked.

“Has Old Herm come out yet?”

“Ain’t seen him.”

Flash loitered where he could watch the rear door. Within
vjù`Åü“%�P‡�f
men from the night shift began to trickle out in twos and
v±tÅîÀfÄqž�
Herm was one of the last. The watchman did not glance tow
7y½&ÔãÖhˆQ“�j	²
dock. With a tin lunch pail swinging from his arm, he sta

the street.

Waiting until the old man was some distance away, Flash f
9gµi×î×fÄw†Ét¦
the first time in his life that he had deliberately set h
?fªcÌí“<Œ[Ò�b¾
of trailing an acquaintance, and he felt somewhat ridicul

Old Herm, unaware that he was being observed, walked seve

entered a restaurant which specialized in twenty-five cen

for the watchman to come out again.

“This was a crazy idea anyhow,” he thought. “Herm may not

Just at that moment the watchman came out of the café. Fl

Again Old Herm started off at a leisurely pace, walking t

waterfront. Flash correctly guessed that he was heading f

Presently the watchman climbed the steps of a dingy, brow

then was free to carry out his plan.

Eight o’clock found him at Old Herm’s rooming place. With
9~­&ÒâÝ/�P•Éw°
bell, he entered the front hall. Scanning the mail boxes 
>nùuÁü“<Œ_†Éw°
watchman occupied suite 15.

Moving noiselessly up the dark stairway, Flash located th
3+·sÍéÖ:ÄQœÉw°
second floor. He listened a moment and tested the door. I
"+®gÓ«ß'‡U—�#¦
he had anticipated. However, he was fully prepared, havin
1+©tÏýÚ,�Z

The lock was of the common type. Flash gained entrance wi

difficulty and took the precaution of re-fastening the do

A hasty glance about revealed a dirty, untidy two-room ap

he washed the pile of dishes in the sink.

Flash moved quickly to the window, lowering a shade which

attract the attention of any other person in the building

Turning around once more, his gaze focused upon a picture

Beneath it, lay a white carnation.

“That must be a picture of Dick Ronne,” thought Flash. “P

“But since I’m here, I may as well look around,” he decid

like a crook doing it though!”

Taking care to disturb nothing, he began a systematic ins

room. He pulled out bureau drawers, looking beneath piles

underclothing. There was no sign of a blackjack or any we

Flash had convinced himself that further search was usele

gaze roamed back to the center table. Several books were

The title of one of the volumes captured his attention. I

“Newspaper Photography.” And beside the book was a more t

treatment on the subject of darkroom procedure.

“Now why would Old Herm be interested in photography?” mu

don’t believe he even owns a camera.”

Opening one of the volumes at random, he found several ma

As Flash read one of the paragraphs, he heard a heavy ste

Dropping the book, Flash barely had time to reach up and

Barely had he rolled beneath it when the outside door ope

                            _A CAMERA TRAP_


The old man did not appear to notice that a blind had bee

Daring to peer forth, Flash saw that the watchman was rea

“Wonder why Herm has the evening off?” he thought. “He ce

While Flash suffered both mental and physical discomfort

The photographer was afraid to shift his position lest he

When it seemed to him that every muscle of his body had t

knot, Old Herm put aside the book. He pulled on his shoes

himself a cup of coffee, and then donned warmer outer clo

“Back to the old grind,” Flash heard him mutter. “Bells,

Always a-ringin’ the darn things.”

A moment later, the watchman switched off the lights, and

apartment, locked the door behind him.

Flash waited until the footsteps had died away. Then he r

under the bed, brushing dust from his suit.

Without bothering to glance again at the photography book

$¼b€ãÒ$ˆÒˆm
locked the door after himself. He reached the street in t

glimpse of the watchman disappearing around a corner.

Flash believed that Old Herm meant to return to the _Ledg

Drawing near the newspaper building, the watchman turned

Old Herm took a coin from his hand and gave it to Jeff. W

Flash waited an interval before approaching the colored b

“Lookin’ fer someone?” the boy asked.

“Just killing time,” Flash returned. “How are you making

“I suppose you pick up a little extra money now and then,

“Yes, suh!”

“Old Herm?”

“Ah earned fifty cents from Herm dis last week. De easies

“And what job do you look after for him?” Flash inquired.


Jeff shook his head and grinned. “Ah ain’t ’llowed to tel

Flash understood the colored boy well enough to know that
vc¼&×äÆ$€
divulge the information if offered a small bribe. But he 
%~«kÉøÖ,ÄJšˆw
Jeff then would reveal to Old Herm who had questioned him
x+‘c€ïÖ+�Z—�#º
allow the matter to rest.

“I can guess what Herm has been doing,” he told himself a
%+±c€øß!€–†t	
from the platform. “And if I’m right, his alibi on the ni
1c­&é«ß'—JÒ„z
arson picture isn’t worth a nickel!”

Debating a moment, Flash entered the _Ledger_ building. A
0¼t€îË8ˆQ€€m 
several floors he finally located the watchman in the des
3y­cÄ«Ð'‰N�šj	²
room. Old Herm, who was peering into a supply cupboard, d

photographer until he was close by.

Startled, he slammed the cupboard door shut and stood wit
>+±oÓ«Ñ)‡UÒ�l
it, facing Flash.

“Oh, it’s you!” he exclaimed. “You scared the daylights o
#ùi2«Þ-È
coming in so quiet-like.”

“I believe a burglar could carry off half the building an
2+ iÕ«Ý-’[€
would know it, Herm,” Flash said in a joking tone.

“It ain’t so!” the watchman denied vigorously. “I make my
vy¶sÎïÀh�H—›z
hour just as I’m supposed to do.”

“How come I couldn’t find you around during the last hour
iŸ

“Were you lookin’ for me?” Old Herm asked innocently. “Di

into the basement?”

“No, I didn’t.”

“That’s probably where I was. What is it you want?”

“Nothing now,” replied Flash. “It’s too late. Well, so lo
8lõ&ÓîÖh�Q‡
tomorrow.”

Without a backward glance, he sauntered from the composin
1+«iÏæ“)ŠZÒ„b°
his way to the street. Riding home in the bus, he thought
vd¯cÒ«Ä …JÒ�f
had learned. Old Herm was not the honest, genial person h

believed him to be. The watchman neglected his duties, li
3oùgÂäÆ<ÄW†Å
and displayed a decided tendency to pry.

“Wonder what he was doing in that supply cupboard when I 
%~«vÒâÀ-€š€nXA
he reflected. “Old Herm acted as guilty as the dickens!”

Flash still was thinking about the matter when he went to
v|¶tË«Ç �œŒ{
morning. He rode up the elevator with Joe Wells and they

photography department together.

“You haven’t solved the darkroom mystery yet?” the older 
&c¶rÏìÁ)”V—›
asked jokingly. “Who slugged you and why?”

Flash shook his head.

“Not yet, but I have a few clues. You know, I’m becoming 
5d·pÉåÐ-€½…g
Herm might have had something to do with it.”

Wells laughed. “Any evidence?”

“I’ve learned Herm has been neglecting his duties here. N
9|ùgÎï“<Œ[œÉk
slips off home while he’s supposed to be at work.”

Wells showed surprise at the information, but he did not 
?e­cÒûÁ-�†�f
matter as Flash had expected.

“Old Herm will lose his job if you spread the story aroun
2'M&Èî“:�Nž€fû

“And doesn’t he deserve it?”

“Maybe,” Wells shrugged, “but if Herm lost this job he’d

“And for that reason I’m to let him crack me on the head—

“You’re cracked now!” Wells interrupted with a trace of i

A wave of anger swept over Flash, but it was gone in an i

way, Joe was giving him a warning it would be well to hee
2%ùNÅ«Û)€
forgotten how affectionately Old Herm was regarded by man
/+¶`€ÿÛ-
employees of the _Ledger_. Any hints or direct accusation
%+¸aÁâÝ;�†�f
watchman would only serve to rally many loyal defenders.

“Some day I’ll learn to keep thoughts to myself,” he refl
3h­cÄ«Ô:�Sž�-
“What I need is absolute proof!”

Flash knew of no way to gain evidence against the old man
z+¸hÄ«Û-ÄV“�
moments when he even doubted that the fellow was responsi

loss of the arson picture.

“But if Herm didn’t do it, then it must be Fred Orris,” h
3+«cÁøÜ&�ZÜ
“Both of them had the opportunity.”

And then an idea came to Flash. In thinking over past eve

upon him that always when he had encountered difficulties

darkroom, he had been working on an important story. Evid
3e­jÙ«Ç �
person who plotted his undoing bided his time, waiting un
"bµ&Èî“?…MÒ€m
possession of an unusual picture.

“I’ll set up a camera trap in the darkroom!” he decided. 
Å_±cÎ«úÚˆRÒ™b¦
around the word that I have some remarkable shots! That s

enticing bait for my victim!”

His mind made up, Flash only awaited a suitable opportuni
"rù`Ïù“8‘J†€m 
his plan into effect. Knowing that Fred Orris nearly alwa

v±gÔ«Ö>�P›‡d
to carry out his scheme.

Slipping into the office when it was deserted, Flash set

in a corner of the darkroom, focusing it upon the drying

“Now if only one of the regular photographers doesn’t bar

Taking another camera from the equipment case, he left th

where he could watch the main entrance of the _Ledger_. P

“Now my act begins!” Flash thought. “And if it doesn’t co

He quickly left the café and returned to the _Ledger_ off

chat for a moment with Old Herm. He would be able to clip

“Where’s the fire, Evans?” Fred Orris demanded as he rush

“Big story!” Flash tossed over his shoulder, barely pausi

“Riot! No! Where?”

“Silverman’s Chain Store warehouse. Employees have been o

there for a week. Tonight the fireworks started!”

The “fireworks” consisted of a rock having been thrown th

warehouse window, but Flash allowed the two men to draw t

conclusions.

Fred Orris gazed after the young photographer with an exp

mingled envy and irritation.

“And I suppose you just happened to be out there,” he sai

Flash tapped his holders. “Wait until you see what I have

boasted. “The best pictures of my career—I hope! I’m putt

He ran on up the stairway.

Had his little act gone over? Flash could not be sure. If
vM«cÄ«ü:–W�
doubted the story he could prove it false in three minute

and Old Herm had seemed impressed.

Unlocking the photography department, Flash closed the do

Slipping outside again, he carefully closed the door. The

Hiding himself behind the power cabinets of the wirephoto

                             _ACCUSATIONS_


The minutes passed slowly. Flash had begun to think that

Fred Orris entered the room. He crossed to his desk and,

Flash’s pulse quickened as he saw the man pause. Orris se

“Now why did he hesitate?” thought Flash. “Perhaps he int

Deciding to carry out the test for a few minutes longer,

reached his ears. Some other person was approaching from 
"c¼&ÏûÃ'—W†Œ
direction!

Softly, an inch at a time, the hall door swung open. Peer

of a man.

The intruder stood motionless for a moment before gliding

“Anyone inside?” he asked in a low tone.

The man repeated his question. When there was no reply, h

pushed open the door. Flash became tense with anxiety. Su

Then suddenly he saw the flare of light and heard a mutte

“I might have guessed where the films were hidden,” Flash

Instead of opening the case, Old Herm stooped and ran his

narrow crack behind it.

“Here, let me do that,” offered Flash quickly. “You might

With Orris’ help he moved the heavy supply case. On the f

Two of the Tower pictures had been ruined by exposure to

Flash hastened back to the photography department. The do

Orris turned it over to him. The detective studied the pr

“If the picture runs, McCormand may have a tip-off before

“How long will that take?” Flash interposed.

“Can’t tell. We may be able to round him up tonight. Agai

                           _FRONT PAGE STORY_


The night was one long to be remembered. In the police ca
$'ù@ÌêÀ Ä_œ�
Fred Orris rode to the McCormand home on Aldingham Drive.
v_±cÒî“<Œ[‹
learned from a maid that the man they sought was attendin
1+¸&ÌêÇ-
business conference at his downtown office.

Back-tracking, the police car presently drew up before a 
!c°rÅ«À<‹P—
building not far from the _Brandale Ledger_. Nearly all o
0+­nÅ«Ä!ŠZ�žp
were dark, but lights glowed in one of the offices on the

The building directory provided information that McCorman

Detective Burnett was assigned to post himself on the fir

directly opposite Room 407, and the two photographers cho
%nùrÏ«Ò+‡QŸ™b	¬
him. Gaining access to it from the third floor, they move
2+·iÉøÖ$�M�…z
to the window.

Inside they could see McCormand at his desk, talking with
v®i€äÇ �LÒ„f	û
One of them Flash instantly recognized as the same person
v|±i€ãÒ,Ä\—Œm
involved in the Fenmore warehouse affair.

A loud knock came on the office door. McCormand sprang to

“Who’s there?” he called sharply.

“Open up or we’ll break down the door!” came the order.

McCormand jerked his head toward the window. His two comp

detective. Flash and Orris took pictures simultaneously.

The detective backed his prisoners into the office again,
v`¼cÐâÝ/ÄJšŒn
covered with his revolver.

“What is the meaning of this intrusion?” demanded McCorma
8oùqÒêÇ ‚Kž…zI
“I demand an explanation.”

“You’ll get it,” said Burnett coolly.

Flash unlocked the door and let the other detective into

the shutter. As Detective Kimball told McCormand he was u

Protesting angrily, the lawyer and his companions were hu

downstairs to the waiting police car. Flash and Orris bot

action shots of McCormand trying to free himself from the
vl«gÓû“'‚†žl
detectives.

“Not bad,” chuckled Orris as they stood watching the car 
2y°pÅ«Ò?…GÜ

“We haven’t any time to waste,” said Flash abruptly. “If 
!nùkÏýÖh‚_��#°
still have a chance to make that last edition.”

The words spurred Orris to action. Running nearly all of 
"c¼&ÄâÀ<…P‘Œ#º
the _Ledger_ building, they related their story of the ca
&¬tÅ«Ú&Ä_Ò�f
terse sentences.

“We’ll hold the edition ten minutes,” Dan Dewey decided. 
ÅL¼r€éÆ;�f

Flash and Orris rushed their pictures through in record t
?f¼*€æÒ#�P•
prints from wet negatives. Not until each picture had bee
8+ºgÐÿÚ'Š[–Éb	±
sent to the photo-engraving department did they allow the
;x¼jÖîÀh…
moment to relax.

“What a night!” said Flash, sinking into a chair. “Wonder
v|±gÔ«Ñ-‡_ŸŒ#³
Old Herm?”

Orris shrugged in his characteristic way.

“Who cares? He won’t make you any more trouble. I imagine

show up at the _Ledger_ again after what happened. But if
vc¼&ÓãÜ=ˆZÒ‹f
dumb enough to try to keep his job, I’ll drop a hint in t

ear.”

“We’ve probably seen the last of Old Herm,” Flash agreed.
v˜ŸtÏæ“&‹IÒ†m
things should roll a lot smoother for me.”

There was an awkward pause. Orris avoided looking directl

he said:

“I owe you an apology. The truth is, I didn’t like you ve

to be put in his place.”

“Guess you weren’t far wrong at that.”

“Yes, I was,” Orris denied. “You had the stuff even if it

“I did slip up on the fight pictures, Fred. The other mis

“Thanks,” returned Flash. Coming from Orris, the praise w

He added: “But I still have plenty to learn.”

He bore the head photographer no grudge. From now on he w

e¼&ÃäÆ$€žŒb»
a great deal from him.

Flash felt worn out from the night’s work. However, befor

home, he printed up the one good Tower picture and droppe

“No, I’m too tired,” Flash yawned. “I’m going home and hi

“You might get a by-line,” Orris hinted. “And you know wh

“No, what?”

“Usually a raise.”

“I could do with one,” grinned Flash. “Well, I think I’ll

“I’m sticking around for a few minutes longer,” Orris rep

Flash left the building and, after a wait of ten minutes

caught his bus home. Wearily he sagged into the first emp

“And the darkroom mystery is solved, too,” he chuckled. “

The bus presently stopped at a corner. A well-dressed man

came into the car, settling himself in the vacant seat be
